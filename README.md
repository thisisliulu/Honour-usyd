Welcome to the official repository for my Honour Thesis at the University of Sydney! I'm thrilled to have you here. This README note will provide you with all the necessary information about my thesis, so let's dive right in!

# Thesis Title
The title of my Honour Thesis is **Multi-source Source-free Domain Adaption for Medical Image Analysis**. It's an exciting and innovative research project that I've been working on throughout my academic journey.

## Thesis Abstract
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods are important for multi-center medical image analysis, aiming to extract knowledge from labeled source domains and transfer it to a separate target domain. However, the traditional UDA method requires source data during transferring, and it is not
feasible in most real-world cases due to reasons like device storage limitation or privacy data protection. Source-free domain adaption (SFDA) methods have been proposed for domain adaption without sharing raw data. In this work, we propose an SFDA framework for multi-source UDA by improving the generalization abilities of the source models. Specifically, we propose a disentanglement-based model that utilizes both real data and synthetic data to enhance the feature extraction process, so that the generated feature can be
not only significant to label classification but also domain-invariant. Based on extensive experiments on several medical image benchmark datasets, the proposed model is indicated to be effective by outperforming the baseline model by a large margin.
